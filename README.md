# Base editing prediction model used in Sakata, Ishiguro, Mori et al. (2020)

## Installation and User Manual
This is a Python script used in Sakata, Ishiguro, Mori et al (2020) to predict frequencies of base editing patterns for a given input sequence using a model trained using amplicon sequencing data obtained for a specific base editing method. Let <img src=images/S_i.png width=14 height=14> be the nucleotide base transition status at *i* bp position relative to the PAM at the target site and <img src=images/P_si.png width=36 height=16> be the probability of  <img src=images/S_i.png width=14 height=14>. A base editor model is prepared as a profile of <img src=images/P_si.png width=36 height=16> and <img src=images/P_sjsi.png width=55 height=18> that can be prepared from amplicon sequence data of different target sites treated with the corresponding base editor (sample codes to generate a base editing model from amplicon data can be found in sample_training_codes/).


In this script, a predicted frequency of a given editing pattern for an input target sequence is calculated by the following formula:



<img src=images/equation.png width=250>

 

where
<img src=images/S_mn.png width=32 height=16> is a base editing pattern in a window spanning from *m* bp *n* bp relative to the PAM, which can be alternatively represented by a string of transition statuses,<img src=images/S_list.png width=140>,

<img src=images/difinition.png width=250>,



This script also enables to predict frequencies of the all possible base editing patterns for an input target sequence and generate an expected editing spectrum with total base editing frequencies across different positions relative to the PAM.

````

**Data type:** TP (transition probability) or CTP (Conditional transition probability)

**Conditional base transition:** {Relative position from the PAM}:{nucleotide transition pattern}. This should be left empty when the data type is TP, or ignored

**Target base transition:** {Relative position from the PAM}:{nucleotide transition pattern}

**Probability:** Probability of the target base transition (TP) or probability of the target base transition given the conditional base transition (CTP)
